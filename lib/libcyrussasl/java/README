after a "make install"
class files are installed in

$(prefix)/lib/java/classes/sasl

to compile programs using it, do:

javac -classpath /usr/java/lib/classes.zip:/usr/local/lib/java/classes/sasl <file>.java

(make sure to substitute your JDK for /usr/java/lib/classes.zip)

to run, do

java -classpath <same path as above> <YourProgram>

----------------------------
This is a java version of the SASL libraries. It supports all the
mechanisms in the C version and conforms to the internet draft in the
doc/ directory. JNI is used.

Sample applications exist in the Test/ directory.

They generally can be run with something like:

java -debug -classpath
../:/usr/java/lib/classes.zip:/usr/obj/sasl/java/:. jimtest -p 2143 -m
KERBEROS_V4 cyrus-dev

and

java -debug -classpath
../:/usr/java/lib/classes.zip:/usr/obj/sasl/java/:. testserver


Any feedback is welcome.
