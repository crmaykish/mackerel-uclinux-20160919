* Short term:

- add missing functions (FIXED)

- review per-target error handling

- dn cache and cache exploitation to refine the candidate selection (?) (FIXED)

- review the group stuff (also in back-ldap!) (FIXED)

- review the attribute stuff (also in bacl-ldap)
  note: this requires changing the acl stuff that checks "dnattr"
  to call a backend specific function that determines what need 
  be done to retrieve the "dnattr" attribute from an entry.

- rework compare and bind to attempt to operate on all candidate entries
  while checking at most one succeedes (FIXED, check bind)

- clear previously bound targets when the bind is repeated (FIXED)

- apply new logging to all the stuff (also in back-ldap)

* Long term:

- distributed entries
