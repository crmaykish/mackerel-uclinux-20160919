* Mon Apr 30 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- split back-meta from back-ldap
- inplement init, config, bind, search, unbind

* Tue May 01 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- refined search propagation based on scope; in case of base shorter
	than candidate target suffix:
		"sub" propagates to all candidate targets,
		"one" propagates to candidate targets only if base is
		no more than one level shorter than suffix; in such
		case scope is changed into "base"
		"base" does not propagate (no such object error)

* Tue May 01 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- added checks in config.c
- fixed leaks in search.c

* Fri May 04 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- added dn cache
- added test

* Sat May 05 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- added missing functions
- fixed flaw in group/attribute funcs (affects also back-ldap)
  now meta_back_group works fine (group ACLS); nothing to say
  about meta_back_attribute: unable to trigger it!
- attributes with dn syntax are rewritten back in search results
  (otherwise "dnattr"-style ACLs don't work). Now attrs with
  dn syntax need be rewritten forth in add/modify ...

* Sun May 06 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- attributes with dn syntax are rewritten during add/modify operations
  (otherwise "dnattr"-style ACLs don't work).
- same back/forth rewriting has been applied to back-ldap;
  actually, the add/modify rewriting function has been implemented
  in bacl-ldap (ldap_dnattr_rewrite) and recycled in back-meta
- fixed bug in invocation of meta_back_dobind in delete.c
- code for deletion of "lastmod" attrs has been commented;
  explicit "lastmod off" has been recommended in FAQ.
- fixed a missing return in suffix_massage_config

* Sun May 06 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- fixed flaw in group.c both in back-ldap and back-meta: the group ndn
  was not rewritten.

* Tue May 08 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- removed the limitation on target naming contexts; now they can be the same
- added support for default target; it may be disabled or set to one of
  the targets, resulting in that target being selected any time there's
  a non-unique target selection (the target is missing or multiple targets
  are selected for a add/modify/delete/compare/... operation).
  TODO: should be more flexible, e.g. let the administrator decide
  whether the default target may be used or not.
- fixed a subtle bind/cache bug.
- added helpers to clear target connections when they're no longer candidate.

* Wed May 09 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- reworked connection stuff in a separate file
- reworked meta_back_getconn to handle singe/multiple target selection
  correctly and atomicly
- checked attribute mapping stuff

* Fri May 11 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <ando@sys-net.it>
- reworked compare to spawn the request on candidate targets
