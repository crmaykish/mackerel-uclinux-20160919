.SH NAME
slapd-ldap \- LDAP backend to slapd
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The LDAP backend to
.BR slapd (8)
is not an actual database; instead it acts as a proxy to forward incoming
requests to another LDAP server. While processing requests it will also
chase referrals, so that referrals are fully processed instead of being
returned to the slapd client.
.SH CONFIGURATION
These
.B slapd.conf
options apply to the LDAP backend database.
That is, they must follow a "database ldap" line and come before any
subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.
Other database options are described in the
.BR slapd.conf (5)
manual page.
.LP
Note: It is strongly recommended to set
.RS
lastmod  off
.RE
for every
.B ldap
and
.B meta
database.
This is because operational attributes related to entry creation and
modification should not be used, as they could be passed to the target
servers, generating an error.
.TP
.B uri <ldapurl>
LDAP server to use.  Multiple URIs can be set in in a single
.B ldapurl
argument, resulting in the underlying library automatically 
call the first server of the list that responds, e.g. 

\fBuri "ldap://host/ ldap://backup-host"\fP

The URI list is space- or comma-separated.
.TP
.B server <hostport>
Obsolete option; same as `uri ldap://<hostport>/'.
.TP
.B binddn "<administrative DN for access control purposes>"
DN which is used to query the target server for acl checking; it
should have read access on the target server to attributes used on the
proxy for acl checking.
There is no risk of giving away such values; they are only used to
check permissions.
.TP
.B bindpw <password>
Password used with the bind DN above.
.TP
.B rebind-as-user
If this option is given, the client's bind credentials are remembered
for rebinds when chasing referrals.
.TP
.B suffixmassage <suffix> <massaged (remote) suffix>
DNs ending with <suffix> in a request are changed to end with <remote
suffix> before sending the request to the remote server, and <remote
suffix> in the results are changed back to <suffix> before returning
them to the client.
The <suffix> field must be defined as a valid suffix
for the current database.
.TP
.B map "{attribute | objectclass} [<local name> | *] {<foreign name> | *}"
Map attribute names and object classes from the foreign server to
different values on the local slapd.
The reason is that some attributes might not be part of the local
slapd's schema, some attribute names might be different but serve the
same purpose, etc.
If local or foreign name is `*', the name is preserved.
If local name is omitted, the foreign name is removed.
Unmapped names are preseved if both local and foreign name are `*',
and removed if local name is omitted and foreign name is `*'.
.TP
.B rewrite*
The rewrite options are described in the "REWRITING" section of the
.BR slapd-meta (5)
manual page.
.SH EXAMPLES
This maps the OpenLDAP objectclass `groupOfNames' to the Active
Directory objectclass `group':
.LP
.RS
.nf
map objectclass groupOfNames group
.fi
.RE
.LP
This presents a limited attribute set from the foreign
server:
.LP
.RS
.nf
map attribute cn *
map attribute sn *
map attribute manager *
map attribute description *
map attribute *
.fi
.RE
.LP
These lines map cn, sn, manager, and description to themselves, and 
any other attribute gets "removed" from the object before it is sent 
to the client (or sent up to the LDAP server).  This is obviously a 
simplistic example, but you get the point.
