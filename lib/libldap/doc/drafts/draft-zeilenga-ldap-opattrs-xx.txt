Abstract

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) supports a mechanism
  for requesting the return of all user attributes but does not all
  operational attributes.   This document describes an LDAP extension
  which clients may use to request the return of all operational
  attributes.

1.  Overview

  X.500 [X.500] provides a mechanism for clients to request all
  operational attributes be returned with entries provided in response
  to a search operation.   This mechanism is often used by clients to
  discover which operational attributes are present in an entry.

  This documents extends LDAP [RFC2251] to provide a simple mechanism
  which clients may use to request the return of all operation
  attributes.  The mechanism is designed for use with existing general
  purpose LDAP clients (including web browsers which support LDAP URLs)
  and existing LDAP API.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


2.  All Operational Attributes

  The presence of the attribute description "+" (ASCII 43) in the list
  of attributes in a Search Request SHALL signify a request for the
  return of all operational attributes.

  As with all search requests, client implementors should note that
  results may not include all requested attributes due to access
  controls or other restrictions.  Clients implementors should also note
  that certain operational attributes may be returned only if requested
  by name even when "+" is present.  This is because some operational
  attributes are very expensive to return.

  Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the Object Identifier
  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.1 as a value of the supportedFeatures [FEATURES]
  attribute in the root DSE.


3.  Interoperability Considerations

  This mechanism is specifically designed to allow users to request all
  operational attributes using existing LDAP clients.  In particular,
  the mechanism is designed to be compatible with existing general
  purpose LDAP clients includes web browsers which support LDAP URLs
  [RFC2255].

  The addition of this mechanism to LDAPv3 is believed not to cause any
  significant interoperability issues (this has been confirmed through
  testing).   Servers which have yet to implement this specification
  should ignore the "+" as an unrecognized attribute description per

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-opattrs-03          17 May 2002


  [RFC2251, Section 4.5.1].  From the client's perspective, a server
  which does not return all operational attributes when "+" is requested
  should be viewed as having other restrictions.

  It is also noted that this mechanism is believed to require no
  modification of existing LDAP APIs.


4.  Security Considerations

  This document provides a mechanism which clients may use to discover
  operational attributes.  Those relying on security by obscurity SHOULD
  implement appropriate access controls to restricts access to
  operational attributes per local policy.


5.  IANA Considerations

  No IANA assignments are requested.

  This document uses the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.1 to identify the
  feature described above.  This OID was assigned [ASSIGN] by OpenLDAP
  Foundation under its IANA assigned private enterprise allocation
  [PRIVATE] for use in this specification.


6.  Acknowledgment

  The "+" mechanism is believed to have been first suggested by Bruce
  Greenblatt in a November 1998 post to the IETF LDAPext Working Group
  mailing list.
