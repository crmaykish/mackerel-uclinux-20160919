Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents
at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

OpenLDAP maintains copies of drafts for which we find interesting.
Existance here does not necessarily imply any support nor any plans
to support for the I-D.  The I-Ds found in this directory may be
stale, expired, or otherwise out of date.

Please refer to http://www.ietf.org/ for latest revisions (and
status).
