6300-DX JTAG
------------

The openocd jtag package can be used with the AR9331 based 6300-DX boards.
It can quite easily be used to program the SPI flash with some support scripts
and tools in the uClinux-dist.

As of this writing I am using openocd-0.6.1. Later versions should work ok.
I am using a simple MIPS parallel port jtag debug dongle, that we hand built
in the lab. Nothing special, google around and you find schematics for them.

With the JTAG adapter conected to the 6300-DX board run openocd with:

    openocd -f tools/openocd/targets/6300-dx.cfg

Then issue the following commands:

    reset halt
    halt
    flash-program

The flashing code will output its progress on the serial ports console. You
need to send the boot load binary on the serial port to the board (this is
a much quicker method then transfering the boot loader through the jtag
interface). To do that you simply do:

    cat u-boot.bin >> /dev/ttyS4

(In this case ttyS4 is just an example, use whatever serial port the board
console is connected too).

Once the erase and flashing has completed the console will report with a
done message. At this point you can exit the debugger. You will need to
repower the board to get it to boot normally again.
