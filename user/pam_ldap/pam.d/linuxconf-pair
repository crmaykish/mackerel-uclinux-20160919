# You can change this file, but anything other than prompting the user
# for a password is added to the stack, authentication will always fail.
# Linuxconf only uses this stack for protocol authentication of a
# username/password pair.
# For all other authentication, it uses the linuxconf service.
# For password changing, it uses the passwd service, so it will
# conveniently share your configuration for the passwd program.
