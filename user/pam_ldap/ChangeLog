===============================================================

180	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	  policy error was returned (CERT VU#778916)

179	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* more manual page updates

178	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

168	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* define LDAP_DEPRECATED for compiling with
	  OpenLDAP 2.2
	* send old password when calling password change
	  extended operation: if the password had expired
	  the user may not be bound and so relying on the
	  LDAP connection to be authenticated is unwise

167	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* fix compilation error on Solaris 9

149	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* OS X build fix
	* alias for RACF password changing
	* use LDAP_MOD_ADD when changing NDS passwords rather
	  than LDAP_MOD_REPLACE; NDS documentation indicates
	  that this should work, and this is required for RACF.
	* BUG#101: should build with recent automake/autoconf

148	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* check for Netscape SDK without SSL; don't require
	  pthreads for these

147	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* make shadow.lstchg default -1 to not force
 	  password change when now shadow information present

146	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	  and fix error propagation with expiring passwords

145	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* patch for building on OpenLDAP 1.x from Nalin
	  at RedHat

144	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* avoid use of temporary variable when reporting

	* log correct configuration file name when reporting
	  missing "host" directive

143	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* specify runtime path for LDAP library correctly to

	* further fix for recall #8362: do not turn
	  all users into template users

139	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* fix for recall #8362: support template users 
	  when try_first_pass succeeds

138	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* when flushing cached session data, check to see
	  whether the application has requested a different
	  configuration file due to a changed service

137	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* treat exceeded time and size limits as a successful

136	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* module stack fixes from Thorsten Kukuk

135	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* revert UID check to getuid() per patch from
	  Erich Schneider
	
134	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* per suggest from Bill Welliver, check for
	  effective UID being 0, not real UID
	* added ber_free() after ber_flatten() in 
	  extended operation password changing code

133	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* Patch from Ed Golden for group_dn: set error
	  code correctly

132	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* Patch from Bob Guo to discard trailing whitespace
	  in configuration file

131	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* allow "*" wildcard value to be present in host
	  attribute
	* added ignore_unknown_user option to all module
	  functions; if the user could not be found and this
	  option is set, PAM_IGNORE will be returned instead
	  of PAM_USER_UNKNOWN

130	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* don't return PAM_AUTH_ERR for authorization errors;
	  return PAM_PERM_DENIED
	* reverted patch in pam_ldap-114: if a user doesn't
	  exist in LDAP, pam_sm_acct_mgmt() returns
	  PAM_IGNORE, rather than PAM_SUCCESS.
	* HEADS UP: in default configuration, disable checking
	  the host attribute. This must now be manually
	  enabled with pam_check_host_attr in ldap.conf.
	* HEADS UP: if checking the host attribute is
	  enabled, and a user does not have any values for
	  the host attribute, do not allow them to login.
	  This avoids the ugly situation of having to add
	  a dummy, invalid value for the host attribute for
	  users that were not allowed to login to any host.

129	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* don't return PAM_SYSTEM_ERR for LDAP-related errors
	* return PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL for directory-related
	  (but not configuration-related) errors so that
	  stacking modules will work properly (thanks to
	  Brian Nelson <bnelson@cis.ysu.edu> for pointing this
	  out)

127	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* fixed segfault bug if nss_base_passwd contains
	  a scope but no filter (BUG#69)

126	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* fixed rebind prototype in pam_ldap.h for new
	  OpenLDAP client library

125	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* added ldap.conf stanza for AIX
	* added configurable checking host host attribute
	  (pam_check_host_attr in ldap.conf)

124	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* note in ldap.conf that the default encryption
	  scheme for changing passwords is none (let
	  the server do it) (BUG#65)
	* pass NULL as session handle for SSL options;
	  they are set globally

123	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* support for new OpenLDAP rebind procedure
	* do not try to open /etc/ldap.secret unless root
	* use LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT if available

122	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* make buildable with Sun's C compiler

121	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* escape username only, not entire filter

120	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* escape search filter to avoid wildcards etc
	* put prototypes back in, where did they go?

119	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* with password change exop, use bind password not encoded
	  old password for old password
	* added --disable-ssl option to configure for Debian
	* patch from Helmut Wirth <wirth@bison-soft.de> to allow
	  only a URI to be specified.
	* only set SSL options if we have values for those options

118	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* in _set_ssl_options(), apply the options actually to
	  the current session not a NULL pointer (which apparently
	  worked with ldap_pvt_tls_set_option())

117	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* do not strdup a NULL pointer if we are root
	  when changing passwords

116	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* make sure old authentication token is zeroed
	  out before freeing (now that we are storing the
	  old authentication token privately)

115	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* fix for updating passwords (consistent for Linux/Solaris)

114	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* patch from Brian Nelson <bnelson@cis.ysu.edu>; if
	  a user doesn't exist in LDAP, then make pam_sm_acct_mgmt()
	  return PAM_SUCCESS
	* another patch for correctly updating passwords on
	  Solaris (which doesn't do preliminary password changing
	  the same was as Linux-PAM)

113	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* don't use ldap_pvt_tls_set_option(); it is private API

112	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* SSL fix

111	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* further patch from Tero to fix chfn/chsh
	* further patch from Jarkko for TLS/SSL using
	  OpenLDAP: support for LDAPS, cipher suite
	  selection, client key/cert authentication

110	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* build on Mac OS X FCS; configure --libdir=/Library
	  (this will only work properly on HFS+ volumes)

109	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* patch from Tero Pelander <tpeland@tkukoulu.fi> for
	  testing scope in nss_base_passwd
	* patch from Jarkko Turkulainen <jt@wapit.com> for client
	  side certificate support

108	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* patch from Thorsten Kukuk <kukuk@suse.de>:
	  The problem: pam_ldap does not abort in the second
	  pam_sm_chauthtok call, if we really change the password
	  and the user does not exist in the LDAP database (tested
	  with pam_ldap-105 and pam_ldap-107).

107	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* s/HAVE_LDAP_SET_REBIND_PROC_ARGS/LDAP_SET_REBIND_PROC_ARGS/
	  (typo causing prototype mismatch)

106	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* URI support
	* cleaned up some warnings with older client 
	  libraries

105	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* check for HAVE_LDAP_{SET,GET}_OPTION always

104	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* check for ldap_set_option(), as LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS
	  is defined for OpenLDAP 1.x but without the
	  ldap_set_option() function

103	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* patch from Thomas Noel to handle shadow
	  expiry properly

102	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	  not defined
	* make SECSPERDAY 86400LL

101	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	  change, may not have been done if we were root.

100	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* use -rpath on all platforms except Solaris,
	  not just Linux

	* add files for automake happiness

94 	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* default to LDAP protocol version 3
	* documented exop in README
	* link on Solaris with -M mapfile
	* Solaris link with -Wl; will work with
	  gcc only, I think
	* use sysconfdir, not etcdir

93	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* made PAM_CLEAR the default for pam_password,
	  as was originally the case. Don't break
	  existing configurations!

92	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* support for OpenLDAP password change extended
	  operation, if available. Enable with 

		pam_password exop

	  in ldap.conf

91	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* centralized authtok update code. The pam_crypt,
	  pam_ad_passwd, and pam_nds_passwd configuration
	  file keys are deprecated; instead the following
	  configuration file key will be used:

		pam_password [clear|crypt|md5|nds|ad]

	  See README for more information. (NB: The
	  pam_crypt will continue to work so as to not
	  compromise existing deployments.)

90	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	  with OpenLDAP SDK

89	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	  keys

87	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* support for "timelimit" and "bind_timelimit" in 
	  ldap.conf
	* use "nss_base_passwd" for search base preferentially
	  to "base"
	* fixed code order bug in setting TLS option;
	  introduced by patch in pam_ldap-86

86	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* patches from Norbert Klasen:
	* activate either Start TLS or LDAPS with
	  OpenLDAP 2.x using "ssl start_tls" or
	  "ssl yes" respectively in ldap.conf
	* Active Directory password changing

85	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* patches from David Begley:
	* note about using --with-ldap-lib=netscape4

82	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* s/conffile/config; forgot to patch properly

81	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* use MAXPATHLEN instead of PATH_MAX; pam_ldap-80
	  failed on Solaris

80	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* added support for configurable configuration files;
	  you can now specify an alternate configuration file
	  using the config= parameter in pam.conf. This patch
	  was provided by scremer@dohle.com
	* added Solaris-specific linker flag patch from
	  David Begley

79	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* updated shipables for RC

	* added support for OpenLDAP start TLS, from
	  Alex Schlessinger <alex@hq.workspot.com>

72	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* added nasty_ssl_hack() constructor; this
	  dlopens ourself so that we always remain
	  loaded, and ssl_initialized is set across
	  invocations of PAM. Probably the path should
	  not be hardcoded but sourced from config.h.

71	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* call ldapssl_client_init() once only (this doesn't
	  have the desired effect because PAM unloads the
	  library after pam_end() is called)

70	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* in rebind proc, check session->info != NULL
	* in rebind proc, check {user,bind}{dn,pw} != NULL

	* patch from Jungle Lin@judicial.gov.tw to fix
	  logic bug in pam_sm_chauthtok()

59	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* return PAM_SUCCESS for pam_sm_open_session()
	* reorganization of shadow code

49	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* more patches from Scott Balneaves; now just check
	  for shadow expiry date rather than shadowAccount
	  object class
	* added deref parameter to ldap.conf for parity with
	  OpenLDAP

48	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* added patch from Scott Balneaves <sbalneav@legalaid.mb.ca>
	  to read shadowAccount attributes

47	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* included FreeBSD porting fixes

36.BZ37.4	Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>

	* send user credentials of bound_as_user is
	  set, rather than if userpw != NULL
