The following is a list of files and features that are going to be
removed in the mtd-utils source tree.  Every entry should contain what
exactly is going away, why it is happening, and who is going to be doing
the work.  When the feature is removed from the utils, it should also
be removed from this file.

---------------------------
1. Kill --squash-rino-perm and --nosquash-rino-perm parameters of mkfs.ubifs.

Originally, mkfs.ubifs did not have these parameters, and it always set
permissions for the UBIFS root inode to be {uid=gid=root, u+rwx,go+rx}. This was
a bug which was found too late, when mkfs.ubifs had already been used in
production. To fix this bug, 2 new options were introduced:
--squash-rino-perm which preserves the old behavior and --nosquash-rino-perm
which makes mkfs.ubifs use the right permissions for the root
inode. For now --squash-rino-perm is the default, and if neither
--squash-rino-perm nor --nosquash-rino-perm are used, mkfs.ubifs prints a
warning. This was introduced in mtd-utils-1.4.0 (13 Sep 2010).

So the plan is (to be done by Artem Bityutskiy):

1. keep the warning for few releases to make sure users start using one of the
   options. Update the mkfs.ubifs documentation at the web site.
2. make --nosquash-rino-perm to be the default, and remove the warning.
   Update the mkfs.ubifs documentation at the web site.
3. eventually deprecate both options by:
3.1 adding a warning to make users stop using them
3.2 removing both options.
---------------------------
2. nanddump: fail when the -s parameter is not page aligned

nanddump should be consistent with nandwrite, and refuse accepting non page
aligned start addresses. These dumps are most likely useless, since nandwrite
won't write then at this location. Currently only a warning is issued to keep
backward compatibility during a transition period. This should become an error
one release after the next release (current is mtd-utils-1.4.0, 18 Sep 2010).
