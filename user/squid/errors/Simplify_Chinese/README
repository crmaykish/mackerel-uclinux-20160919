This Simplify Chinese error pages is based on the 
Erick C. Chang <erick@mail.thu.edu.tw> 's Traditional Chinese error pages.
and suitable for SQUID 2.3 STABLE 1.

I first translate these pages from Traditional Chinese to Simplify Chinese
use a auto program. Then I check and compare with English pages to get more
accurate result. It take me over one half of time than direct translation 
from english. Because the technical terms are very different in two area. 
And I also fixed some minor mistakes.
