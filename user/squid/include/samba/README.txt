These files are copies of Samba internal headers from Samba-2.2.7a
required by the winbind helpers to Squid.

If you compile the winbind helpers with other versions of Samba you may
need to copy the relevant headers from the Samba version you are using
here, or use the --with-samba-source=... configure option to tell Squid
where the Samba sources can be found.
