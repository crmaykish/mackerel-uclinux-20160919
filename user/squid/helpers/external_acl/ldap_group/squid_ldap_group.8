.SH NAME
squid_ldap_group - Squid LDAP external acl group helper
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
squid_ldap_group -b "base DN" -f "LDAP search filter" [options] [ldap_server_name[:port]|URI]...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This helper allows Squid to connect to a LDAP directory to
authorize users via LDAP groups.
LDAP options are specified as parameters on the command line,
while the username(s) and group(s) to be checked against the
LDAP directory are specified on subsequent lines of input to the
helper, one username/group pair per line separated by a space.
.P
As expected by the external_acl construct of Squid, after
specifying a username and group followed by a new line, this
helper will produce either OK or ERR on the following line
to show if the user is a member of the specified group.
.P
The program operates by searching with a search filter based
on the users user name and requested group, and if a match
is found it is determined that the user belongs to the group.
.
.TP
.BI "-b " "basedn " (REQUIRED)
Specifies the base DN under which the groups are located.
.
.TP
.BI "-B " "basedn "
Specifies the base DN under which the users are located (if different)
.
.TP
.B "-g"
Specifies that the first query argument sent to the helper by Squid is
a extension to the basedn and will be temporarily added in front of the
global basedn for this query.
.
.TP
.BI "-f " filter
LDAP search filter used to search the LDAP directory for any
matching group memberships.
.BR
In the filter %u will be replaced by the user name (or DN if
the -F or -u options are used) and %g by the requested group name.
.
.TP
.BI "-F " filter
LDAP search filter used to search the LDAP directory for any
matching users.
.BR
In the filter %s will be replaced by the user name. If % is to be
included literally in the filter then use %%.
.
.TP
.BI "-u " attr
LDAP attribute used to construct the user DN from the user name and
base dn without needing to search for the user.
.
.TP
.BI "-s " base|one|sub
search scope. Defaults to 'sub'.
.IP
.B base
object only,
.B one
level below the base object or
.BR sub tree
below the base object
.
.TP
.BI "-D " "binddn " "-w " password
The DN and password to bind as while performing searches. Required
if the directory does not allow anonymous searches.
.IP
As the password needs to be printed in plain text in your Squid configuration
and will be sent on the command line to the helper it is strongly recommended
to use a account with minimal associated privileges.  This to limit the damage
in case someone could get hold of a copy of your Squid configuration file or
extracts the password used from a process listing.
.
.TP
.BI "-D " "binddn " "-W " "secretfile "
The DN and the name of a file containing the password
to bind as while performing searches. 
.IP
Less insecure version of the former parameter pair with two advantages:
The password does not occur in the process listing, 
and the password is not being compromised if someone gets the squid 
configuration file without getting the secretfile.
.
.TP
.BI -P
Use a persistent LDAP connection. Normally the LDAP connection
is only open while verifying a users group membership to preserve
resources at the LDAP server. This option causes the LDAP connection to
be kept open, allowing it to be reused for further user
validations. Recommended for larger installations.
.
.TP
.BI -R
do not follow referrals
.
.TP
.BI "-a " never|always|search|find
when to dereference aliases. Defaults to 'never'
.IP
.BI never
dereference aliases (default),
.BI always
dereference aliases, only while
.BR search ing
or only to
.B find
the base object
.
.TP
.BI -H " ldapuri"
Specity the LDAP server to connect to by a LDAP URI (requires OpenLDAP libraries)
.
.TP
.BI -h " ldapserver"
Specify the LDAP server to connect to
.TP
.BI -p " ldapport"
Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listening if
other than the default LDAP port 389.
.
.TP
.BI -v " 2|3"
LDAP protocol version. Defaults to 2 if not specified.
.
.TP
.BI -Z
Use TLS encryption
.
.TP
.BI -E certpath
Enable LDAP over SSL (requires Netscape LDAP API libraries)
.
.TP
.BI -c connect_timeout
Specify timeout used when connecting to LDAP servers (requires
Netscape LDAP API libraries)
.TP
.BI -t search_timeout
Specify time limit on LDAP search operations
.
.TP
.BI -S
Strip NT domain name component from user names (/ or \\ separated)
.
.TP
.BI -d
Debug mode where each step taken will get reported in detail.
Useful for understanding what goes wrong if the results is
not what is expected.

.SH SQUID CONFIGURATION
.
This helper is intended to be used as a external_acl_type helper from
squid.conf.

.SH NOTES
.
When constructing search filters it is recommended to first test the filter
using ldapsearch before you attempt to use squid_ldap_group. This to verify
that the filter matches what you expect.
