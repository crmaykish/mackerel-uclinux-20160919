This is the README file for check_group, an external
helper fo the External ACL Scheme for Squid.

More information about the External ACL scheme may
be found at http://devel.squid-cache.org/external_acl/

This program reads one new line terminated argument in the
standard input (the username and groups) and tries to match it against
several command-line specified groups.

The syntax for the program is as follows:

check_group [-g group1 -g group2 -g group3 ...] [-p]

You may specify up to 11 different groups, this limit may be
increased by changing the MAX_GROUP define in the source code
and recompiling the program.

To compile this program, use:

gcc -o check_group check_group.c


You may specify the group names in the acl, as follows:

acl ckgroup external ckgroup_helper %LOGIN group1 group2 group3


You may get the latest release and more information about this
program at http://geekbunker.org/rodrigo/check_group.html
