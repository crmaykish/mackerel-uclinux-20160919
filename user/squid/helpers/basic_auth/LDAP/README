	LDAP authentication helper for Squid.

This Squid helper allows authentication against LDAP directories
using the "simple authentication" (plain-text).

This code is maintained by Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
who added many command line options, and the ability to search for
the user DN to log in as.

The original LDAP Authentication code is written by Glen Newton
<gnewton@wapiti.cisti.nrc.ca>.

For detailed usage information please see the supplied man page

  nroff -man squid_ldap_auth.8 | less

In order to use squid_ldap_auth, you will also need to install
the OpenLDAP libraries (ldap lber) from http://www.openldap.org.
