28 September 1999, version 0.05

- Easier debugging: added the -d option to smb_auth.

- Bugfix: a password containing a backslash character was always
  denied. Reported by Menno Stevens.

- The -S option now accepts both slashes and backslashes and
  allows the share name to be preceded by a (back)slash.

5 June 1999, version 0.04

- Allow for both \n and \r\n end-of-line termination in the
  proxyauth file located on the PDC. This eliminates the most
  common installation problem.

- The location of the proxyauth file can be changed (for each
  domain) using the new -S option. Useful when the NETLOGON
  share is located on a FAT filesystem.
  Thanks to Colin Manning <colinm@officeinfo.com.au>.

2 Februari 1999, version 0.03

- Support for pass-through authentication (trust relationships)
  added. Suggested by Matthew Wood <woodm@newsltd.com.au>.

- Bugfix: smb_auth.sh searched for the PDC only.

- Many documentation improvements.

9 December 1998, version 0.02

- smb_auth now uses Samba instead of pam_smb. This simplifies the
  installation of smb_auth and increases platform support.

- Access control by user and group: smb_auth now tries to read
  the file \netlogon\proxyauth. By restricting read access on
  this file access to the proxy can be controlled.

- Easier configuration:

  - smb_auth is now fully configurable with command-line options
    (i.e. in squid.conf). No more hacking in the source code.

  - In most cases it is sufficient to specify just the domain name.
    smb_auth searches for a working domain controller on each
    authentication request (note that Squid caches valid requests).

- Easier installation: Makefile added. Simply typing "make install"
  will work for most people.

- In a multi-domain situation, users must now enter domain\user
  instead of user\domain. This conforms to NT notation. Thanks to
  Jason Haar <Jason.Haar@trimble.co.NZ> for pointing this out.
