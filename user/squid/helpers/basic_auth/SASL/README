This program authenticates users using SASL (specifically the
cyrus-sasl authentication method).

SASL is configurable (somewhat like PAM). Each service authenticating
against SASL identifies itself with an application name. Each 
"application" can be configured independently by the SASL administrator.

For this authenticator, the SASL application name is, by default,

	squid_sasl_auth

To configure the authentication method used the file "squid_sasl_auth.conf" 
can be placed in the appropriate location, usually "/usr/lib/sasl".

The authentication database is defined by the "pwcheck_method" parameter.
Only the "PLAIN" authentication mechanism is used.

Examples:

pwcheck_method:sasldb
	use sasldb - the default if no conf file is installed.
pwcheck_method:pam
	use PAM
pwcheck_method:passwd
     use traditional /etc/passwd
pwcheck_method:shadow
     use slightly less traditional /etc/shadow

Others methods may be supported by your cyrus-sasl implementation - 
consult your cyrus-sasl documentation for information.

Typically the authentication database (/etc/sasldb, /etc/shadow, pam)
can not be accessed by a "normal" user. You should use setuid/setgid
and an appropriate user/group on the executable to allow the
authenticator to access the appropriate password database. If the
access to the database is not permitted then the authenticator
will typically fail with "-1, generic error".

	chown root.mail sasl_auth
	chmod ug+s sasl_auth

If the application name ("squid_sasl_auth") will also be used for the
pam service name if pwcheck_method:pam is chosen. And example pam
configuration file  "squid_sasl_auth" is also included.
