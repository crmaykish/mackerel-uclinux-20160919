 * Key generation function to implement the LFU-DA policy (Least

 * but with aging to handle turnover of the popular document set.
 * Maximizes byte hit rate by keeping more currently popular objects
 * in cache regardless of size.  Achieves lower hit rate than GDS
 * because there are more large objects in cache (so less room for
 * smaller popular objects).
 * 
 * This version implements a tie-breaker based upon recency
 * (e->lastref): for objects that have the same reference count
 * the most recent object wins (gets a higher key value).
 *
 * Note: this does not properly handle when the aging factor
 * gets so huge that the added value is outside of the
 * precision of double. However, Squid has to stay up
 * for quite a extended period of time (number of requests)
 * for this to become a problem. (estimation is 10^8 cache
 * turnarounds)
